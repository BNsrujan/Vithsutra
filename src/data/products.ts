Our team now monitors pipeline pressure, pump vibration, and leak indicators in real time across multiple sites. 
The system's threshold-based alarms helped us prevent two major failures in just the first month of deployment. 
It has reduced our unplanned maintenance and strengthened our remote control and safety protocols."`
